## 1. Problem: Repeated DNA Sequences

## Statement

A DNA sequence consists of nucleotides represented by the letters ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘G’, and ‘T’ only. For example, “ACGAATTCCG” is a valid DNA sequence.

Given a string, s, that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (continuous substrings of exactly 10 characters) that appear more than once in s. You can return the output in any order.

Constraints:

- 1 ≤ s.length ≤ 10^3
- s[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.

## 2. Problem: Longest Repeating Character Replacement

## Statement

Given a string s and an integer k, find the length of the longest substring in s, where all characters are identical, after replacing, at most, k characters with any other lowercase English character.

Constraints:

- 1 ≤ `s.length` ≤ 10^3
- `s` consists of only lowercase English characters
- 0 ≤ k ≤ `s.length`.

## 3. Longest Substring without Repeating Characters

## Statement

Given a string, input_str, return the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Constraints:

- 1 ≤ `input_str.length` ≤ 10^5
- `input_str` consists of English letters, digits, and spaces.
