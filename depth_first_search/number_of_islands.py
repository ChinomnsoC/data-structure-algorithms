# The problem: Given a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. 
# An island is surrounded by water and formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
# Example:
# grid = [
#   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
# ]
# Output: 1
