## Statement

Given a string, s, return TRUE if it is a palindrome; otherwise, return FALSE.

Constraints:

1
≤
1≤
 s.length 
≤
3000
≤3000

s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

## Problem: 3Sum

Given an integer array nums, find and return all unique triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]], where the indexes satisfy i ≠

=
j, i
≠

=
k, and j
≠

=
k, and the sum of the elements nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Constraints:

- 3≤ nums.length ≤ 500
- -10 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^3
