## Statement

Given a string, s, return TRUE if it is a palindrome; otherwise, return FALSE.

A phrase is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward after converting all uppercase letters to lowercase and removing any characters that are not letters or numbers. Only alphanumeric characters (letters and digits) are taken into account.

Constraints:

1
≤
1≤
 s.length 
≤
3000
≤3000

s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

## Problem: 3Sum

Given an integer array nums, find and return all unique triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]], where the indexes satisfy i ≠

=
j, i
≠

=
k, and j
≠

=
k, and the sum of the elements nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Constraints:

- 3≤ nums.length ≤ 500
- -10 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^3

## Problem: Sort Colors

Statement
Given an array, colors, which contains a combination of the following three elements:

- 0 (representing red)
- 1 (representing white)
- 2 (representing blue)

Sort the array in place so that the elements of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order of red, white, and blue. To improve your problem-solving skills, do not utilize the built-in sort function.

Constraints:

- 1 ≤ colors.length ≤ 300
- colors[i] can only contain 0s, 1s, or 2s.
